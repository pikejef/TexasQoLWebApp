  <h1>Calculation: Quality of Life Index Score</h1>
<h3>Step 1: Weighted Model</h3>

<p> The calculation process followed four steps. </p>
 <p> The quality of life index score for each Texas county was calculated using a multi-criteria decision-making equation.
    Each of the 8 variables factored in our equation were ranked and then given a <b>weight</b> based on their magnitude of
    importance respectively held in characterizing the quality of life in an area. A weight value for each of the variables was
    designated after group discussion. The weights for all variables would cumulatively sum to 1. </p>

<h3>Step 2: Normalization</h3>
    <p> 6 out of our 8 variables were counts, and these values for each county were normalized per capita. For each of these 6 variables, 
    each Texas county--which there are 254 of--was given a rank from 1-254 based on its normalized value. </p>

<h3>Step 3: Rank & Weighted Rank</h3>
    <p> This ranked value would then be multiplied by the weight designated for the variable being measured.
    Therefore, values with a higher rank <ins>in this step</ins> of the calculation process would give <b>more</b> weight to a county. </p>

<h3>Step 4: Result</h3>
    <p> Finally, each of the 8 weighted rank values for a county would then be summed up. The result would be the
        quality of life index score for that county. Counties with a higher quality of life index score would be considered
        better than those with a lower score.
